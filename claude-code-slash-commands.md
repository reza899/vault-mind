### Error Handling & Guidance

**MCP Issues**:
- Automatic detection of missing ChromaDB MCP
- Step-by-step installation instructions
- Configuration troubleshooting

**Collection Issues**:

- Guides to Vault Mind indexing process
- Explains naming conventions

**Query Issues**:
- Suggests better search terms for poor results
- Provides query optimization tips
- Handles edge cases gracefully

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "chroma_list_collections not found"
**Solution**: ChromaDB MCP is not installed or connected
1. Install ChromaDB MCP in Claude Code
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Verify MCP connection in settings

#### "Collection 'vault_name' not found"
**Solutions**:
1. Check available collections: `/vault-mind "" "list my collections"`
2. Verify vault is indexed in Vault Mind UI: http://localhost:5173
3. Use correct collection name format: `vault_[name]`

#### "No results found"
**Solutions**:
1. Try broader search terms
2. Check collection has content
3. Use different query approaches
4. Verify indexing completed successfully

### Performance Tips

1. **Use specific terms**: "machine learning algorithms" vs "AI stuff"
2. **Include context**: "project management agile methodology" vs "management"
3. **Try variations**: If no results, rephrase your query
4. **Start broad**: Then narrow down with follow-up queries

## üìö Advanced Usage

### Collection Path Formats

```bash
# Standard collection name
/vault-mind my_vault "query here"

# Full path (if needed)
/vault-mind /path/to/chroma_db/collection_name "query here"

# Default Vault Mind naming
/vault-mind vault_mind "query here"
```

### Multi-step Workflows

1. **Explore a topic**:
   ```bash
   /vault-mind my_notes "find everything about leadership"
   ```

2. **Deep dive**:
   ```bash
   /vault-mind my_notes "analyze different leadership styles and their effectiveness"
   ```

3. **Create content**:
   ```bash
   /vault-mind my_notes "create a presentation outline on transformational leadership"
   ```

4. **Test knowledge**:
   ```bash
   /vault-mind my_notes "generate a quiz on leadership theories with explanations"
   ```

### Query Optimization

**Good Examples**:
```bash
# Specific and contextual
/vault-mind research "machine learning applications in healthcare"

# Clear intent
/vault-mind study_notes "create a summary of cognitive psychology theories"

# Natural questions
/vault-mind work_vault "what are the best practices for remote team management?"
```

**Less Effective**:
```bash
# Too vague
/vault-mind notes "stuff about AI"

# Unclear intent  
/vault-mind collection "leadership"
```

## üéØ Best Practices

### Query Formulation
1. **Be specific**: Use detailed terms that match your note content
2. **Include context**: Add relevant context to improve results
3. **State your intent**: Clearly indicate if you want search, quiz, summary, etc.
4. **Use natural language**: Write queries as you would ask a human expert

### Collection Management
1. **Consistent naming**: Use clear, consistent collection names
2. **Regular updates**: Keep your indexed content current
3. **Logical organization**: Organize collections by topic or purpose
4. **Size optimization**: Monitor collection size for performance

### Workflow Integration
1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic searches, then move to complex analysis
2. **Iterate**: Use results to refine follow-up queries
3. **Document patterns**: Note successful query patterns for reuse
4. **Combine approaches**: Mix different query types for comprehensive insights
